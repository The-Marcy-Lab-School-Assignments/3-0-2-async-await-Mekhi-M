# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users";
  const users = await fetch(url)
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUsers();
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

I believe that it will work. Since the whole entire operation of the `fetch().then()` is asynchronous, there should not be an issue with doing it all within one await keyword. Should the data be successfully fetched and converted from readable stream to JSON, the await keyword will then unpack the promise returned by the `fetch().then()` which will return JSON since that will be the resolved value of the returned promise.
