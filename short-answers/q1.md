# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

`Async`/`await` allows us to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner. In a lot of cases we can just write code that we would normally write but just add in the `async` or `await` keywords in the correct place.

`.then` and `.catch` also require callback functions as arguments. It seems to be more natural to write these callbacks inline and that can lead to some hard to detect mistakes. Making sure that your `.then` methods return a value that is stored in a new promise is important when chaining `.then`s together.

Lastly it allows for the usage of `try/catch` that can be used outside of fetching and promises. This ties back to making asynchronous code be more in sync with synchronous code.
